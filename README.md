# Zephir - Documentation site source

This is the official documentation site source code. The site is leveraging Jekyll and is deployed to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)

If you are interested in translating our documents, you can visit [our project in Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/zephir-documentation).

## How to try it out

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:zephir-lang/zephir-docs-app.git
$ cd zephir-docs-app
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

And wait for load any required submodules. After that, we need a few ruby dependencies:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Then, from the root of the blog just run:

```sh
$ ./serve
```

### Easy way pull latest of all submodules

For git 1.6.1 or above you can use something similar to:

```sh
$ cd zephir-docs-app
$ git submodule update --remote --merge
```

See [git-submodule(1)](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.6.1.3/git-submodule.html) for details.
